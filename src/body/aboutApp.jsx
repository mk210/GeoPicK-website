            We are a group of year 3 Computer Science students studying at the
            Heriot Watt university. We have implemented a photo based social
            media application called GeoPicK. More about our team members are
            written below. This team of 8 members have worked constantly for 6
            months to achieve this feat. Since, we are working remotely, it was
            harder for us to work on this project. Luckily, remote tools such as
            MS teams, jira and confluence helped us complete this project.{" "}
